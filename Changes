Revision history for Perl extension List-MoreUtils

0.33 Thu 4 Aug 2011
	- Updated can_xs to fix a bug in it

0.32 Fri May 20 2011    
	- Production release, no other changes

0.31_02 Mon 21 Mar 2011
	- More accurate detection of XS support (ADAMK)

0.31_01 Mon 21 Mar 2011
	- Updating copyright year (ADAMK)
	- Teak documentation of all() and none() (WYANT)
	- Memory leak fixed for apply() and XS version restored (ARC)
	- Memory leak fixed for indexes() and XS version restored (ARC)
	- Memory leak fixed for part() and XS version restored (ARC)

0.30 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
	  a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
	  from the way that List::Util does it.

0.29 Wed 8 Dec 2010
	- Removed an erroneous Test::NoWarnings dependency

0.28 Tue 7 Dec 2010
	- Switching to a production release
	- Restored the regression test for RT #38630 from 0.23.
	  As apply() was disabled in 0.27_04 this test will only act
	  to validate the future XS restoration of apply().
	- Adding uniq warning tests, disabled initially

0.27_04 Mon 6 Dec 2010
	- The behaviour of any/all/none/notall has changed when
	  passed a null list to treat a null list as a legitimate list.
	  Instead of returning C<undef> the functions now return the
	  following: any {} == false, all {} == true, none {} == true,
	  notall {} == false.
	  Resolves #40905: Returning undef when none is passed an empty
	- Disabled the leaking XS versions of part(), apply() and indexes()

0.27_03 Mon 6 Dec 2010
	- General house cleaning

0.27_02 Wed 1 Dec 2010
	- Reduced test suite peak memory consumption by 5-10 meg
	- Added the 'distinct' alias for the uniq function, for people that
	  like their chained map/grep/sort pipelines with a SQL'ish flavour.
	- Expanded test suite for the any() group of functions.
	- The any() group of functions now strictly always return scalar
	  boolean true, false and undef to match the XS version.

0.27_01 Wed 1 Dec 2010
	- Refactored the split test scripts into a common test module
	  to be shared between both the Perl and XS versions.
	- Reapply fix for http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847
	  "minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element"

0.26 Tue 23 Nov 2010
	- No changes
	- Some parts of the CPAN cloud were confusing my 0.24
	  release with the older deleted 0.24. Bumping version
	  past Tassilo's to clarify things.

0.24 Mon 22 Nov 2010
	- No changes, switching to a production version

0.23_01 Sat 25 Sep 2010
	- First attempt at repackaging the List::MoreUtils code in
	  Makefile.PL and release toolchain similar to Params::Util

0.22  Sun Jul  2 11:25:39 EDT 2006
	- SvPV_nolen doesn't exist on pre 5.6 perls

0.21  Sun Jun 18 07:59:06 EDT 2006
	- propagate dies from inside the code-reference of pairwise to 
	  caller

0.20  Tue Apr 25 15:43:57 EDT 2006
	- part() would destroy the list elements when changing
	  an array in place (@list = part { ... } @list)

0.19  Mon Mar 13 19:07:37 CET 2006
	- working down myself the queue of suggestions:
	  part() added
	  (Ricardo SIGNES <rjbs AT cpan DOT org>)

0.18  Sat Feb 25 08:55:48 CET 2006
	- each_arrayref (XS) couldn't deal with refs to list literals
	  (brought up by David Filmer <usenet AT DavidFilmer DOT com>
	   in comp.lang.perl.misc)

0.17  Wed Dec  7 10:45:43 CET 2005
	- each_arrayref had no XS implementation and wasn't
	  mentioned in the PODs
	  (patch by Anno Siegel <siegel AT zrz DOT tu-berlin DOT de>)

0.16  Mon Nov 14 09:57:28 CET 2005
	- a dangling semicolon in some macros prevented
	  the XS portion to compile on some compilers
	  (Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.15  Fri Nov 11 09:23:29 CET 2005
	- 0.13 and 0.14 broke the module on 5.6.x
	  (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)
	- internals changed to make use of the new MULTICALL API 
	  which had to be backported to 5.005_x

0.14  Thu Nov 10 13:08:03 CET 2005
	- 0.13 fixed the leaks but rendered the XS part uncompilable
	  for perls < 5.6.0: Fixed
	  (spotted by Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.13  Wed Nov  9 16:29:02 CET 2005
	- nearly all functions receiving a CODE-block as first
	  argument had a hefty memory-leak: Fixed
	  (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)

0.12  Wed Sep 28 08:09:08 CEST 2005
	- first_index and each_arrayref weren't exportable
	  (spotted by Darren Duncan)

0.11  Tue Sep 27 08:15:22 CEST 2005
	- make sure that Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage are

	- 0.08 only fixed uniq() for scalar context

0.08  Fri Dec  3 17:11:14 CET 2004
	- uniq() was not mentioned in the perldocs and only had
	  the XS implementation
	- uniq() also produced wrong results on 5.8.0
	  (thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and suggesting
	  a workaround)
	- the test-suite triggered a bug in 5.6.x perls
	- the test-suite now tests both the XS- and Perl-implementation
	- a wrong example in the perldocs fixed (Ron Savage)

0.07  Wed Dec  1 07:56:08 CET 2004
	- new functions:
	    after, after_incl, before, before_incl, indexes
	    lastval, firstval, pairwise, each_array, natatime,
	    mesh (all from Eric J. Roodes' List::MoreUtil).

	  Steve Purkis <spurkis AT quiup DOT com>
