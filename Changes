0.30	2010-12-16
    - Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove

      from the way that List::Util does it.

0.29	2010-12-08
    - Removed an erroneous Test::NoWarnings dependency

0.28	2010-12-07
    - Switching to a production release
    - Restored the regression test for RT #38630 from 0.23.
      As apply() was disabled in 0.27_04 this test will only act
      to validate the future XS restoration of apply().
    - Adding uniq warning tests, disabled initially

0.27_04	2010-12-06
    - The behaviour of any/all/none/notall has changed when
      passed a null list to treat a null list as a legitimate list.
      Instead of returning C<undef> the functions now return the
      following: any {} == false, all {} == true, none {} == true,
      notall {} == false.
      Resolves #40905: Returning undef when none is passed an empty
    - Disabled the leaking XS versions of part(), apply() and indexes()

0.27_03	2010-12-06
    - General house cleaning

0.27_02	2010-12-01
    - Reduced test suite peak memory consumption by 5-10 meg
    - Added the 'distinct' alias for the uniq function, for people that
      like their chained map/grep/sort pipelines with a SQL'ish flavour.
    - Expanded test suite for the any() group of functions.
    - The any() group of functions now strictly always return scalar
      boolean true, false and undef to match the XS version.

0.27_01 2012-12-01
    - Refactored the split test scripts into a common test module
      to be shared between both the Perl and XS versions.
    - Reapply fix for http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847
      "minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element"

0.26	2010-11-23
    - No changes
    - Some parts of the CPAN cloud were confusing my 0.24

      past Tassilo's to clarify things.

    - No changes, switching to a production version

0.23_01	2010-09-25

    - MS VC++ 7 doesn't like inline nor 'long long'
      (patch provided by Taro Nishino (taro DOT nishino AT gmail.com)
    - Newx isbn't around in older perls so use New(0,...) instead

0.25_01	2009-07-30
    - it seems the only way of handling the stack that works on all 
      flavors of the multicall API is by making a shallow copy of it
      and use that between the PUSH/POP_MULTICALL bracket
    - fix awkward ok() override in List-MoreUtils.t so that it reports
      line numbers in test failures properly

0.24	2009-07-19
    - List::MoreUtils was not handling the stack properly when the stack was grown
      from inside code-references
    - a couple of tests for each_arrayref were calling each_array 

0.23	2009-04-19
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
      fixed: Returning undef when none is passed an empty array is counterintuitive
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40905)
    - fixed: minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element 
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847)

    - fixed: memory leak in indexes() [XS]
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41494)
    - reduced memory-requirements for the part() tests as that was responsible
      for a lot of unnecessary test-failures
    - new function bsearch() which performs a binary search

0.22	2006-07-02
    - SvPV_nolen doesn't exist on pre 5.6 perls

      (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)

      which had to be backported to 5.005_x

0.14	2005-11-10
