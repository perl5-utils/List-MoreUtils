=head1 NAME

List::MoreUtils - Provide the stuff missing in List::Util

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use List::MoreUtils qw(:tassilo); # use as initially thought
    use List::MoreUtils qw(:alias); # use alias changes
    use List::MoreUtils qw(:modern); # use compat mode to List::Util
    use List::MoreUtils qw(:sno); # use nowadays added stuff

    use List::MoreUtils qw(:all); # use all with precedence 'alias', 'sno', 'tassilo', 'modern';

    use List::MoreUtils any => { impl => 'modern' },
                        all =>  { impl => 'tassilo' },
                        'none', 'notall', # above precedence
                        'firstidx' => { impl => 'tassilo' },
                        all => { impl => 'modern', as => 'modern_all' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<List::MoreUtils> provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
lists which is not going to go into L<List::Util>.

All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
couldn't be compiled on this machine.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols, do the conventional

    use List::MoreUtils ':all';

It may make more sense though to only import the stuff your program actually
needs:

    use List::MoreUtils qw{ any firstidx };

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

When C<LIST_MOREUTILS_PP> is set, the module will always use the pure-Perl
implementation and not the XS one. This environment variable is really just
there for the test-suite to force testing the Perl implementation, and possibly
for reporting of bugs. I don't see any reason to use it in a production
environment.

=head1 BUGS

There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write
things like:

    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };

It has to be written as either

    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } 'foo', 'bar', 'baz';

or

    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;

Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.

If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please
drop me a line. This module's policy will be less strict than L<List::Util>'s
when it comes to additions as it isn't a core module.

When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the
output of your program with the environment variable C<LIST_MOREUTILS_PP> set
to a true value. That way I know where to look for the problem (in XS,
pure-Perl or possibly both).

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker.

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.

=head2 Where can I go for help?

If you have a bug report, a patch or a suggestion, please open a new
report ticket at CPAN (but please check previous reports first in case
your issue has already been addressed).

Report tickets should contain a detailed description of the bug or
enhancement request and at least an easily verifiable way of
reproducing the issue or fix. Patches are always welcome, too - and
it's cheap to send pull-requests on GitHub. Please keep in mind that
code changes are more likely accepted when they're bundled with an
approving test.

If you think you've found a bug then please read
"How to Report Bugs Effectively" by Simon Tatham:
L<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>.

=head2 Where can I go for help with a concrete version?

Bugs and feature requests are accepted against the latest version
only. To get patches for earlier versions, you need to get an
agreement with a developer of your choice - who may or not report the
issue and a suggested fix upstream (depends on the license you have
chosen).

=head2 Business support and maintenance

For business support you can contact Jens via his CPAN email
address rehsackATcpan.org. Please keep in mind that business
support is neither available for free nor are you eligible to
receive any support based on the license distributed with this
package.

=head1 THANKS

Credits go to a number of people: Steve Purkis for giving me namespace advice
and James Keenan and Terrence Branno for their effort of keeping the CPAN
tidier by making L<List::Utils> obsolete. 

Brian McCauley suggested the inclusion of apply() and provided the pure-Perl
implementation for it.

Eric J. Roode asked me to add all functions from his module C<List::MoreUtil>
into this one. With minor modifications, the pure-Perl implementations of those
are by him.

The bunch of people who almost immediately pointed out the many problems with
the glitchy 0.07 release (Slaven Rezic, Ron Savage, CPAN testers).

A particularly nasty memory leak was spotted by Thomas A. Lowery.

Lars Thegler made me aware of problems with older Perl versions.

Anno Siegel de-orphaned each_arrayref().

David Filmer made me aware of a problem in each_arrayref that could ultimately
lead to a segfault.

Ricardo Signes suggested the inclusion of part() and provided the
Perl-implementation.

Robin Huston kindly fixed a bug in perl's MULTICALL API to make the
XS-implementation of part() work.

=head1 TODO

A pile of requests from other people is still pending further processing in
my mailbox. This includes:

=over 4

=item * List::Util export pass-through

Allow B<List::MoreUtils> to pass-through the regular L<List::Util>
functions to end users only need to C<use> the one module.

=item * uniq_by(&@)

Use code-reference to extract a key based on which the uniqueness is
determined. Suggested by Aaron Crane.

=item * delete_index

=item * random_item

=item * random_item_delete_index

=item * list_diff_hash

=item * list_diff_inboth

=item * list_diff_infirst

=item * list_diff_insecond

These were all suggested by Dan Muey.

=item * listify

Always return a flat list when either a simple scalar value was passed or an
array-reference. Suggested by Mark Summersault.
